#Simulation and Fake Data

Why is this important to know how to do?

--

**Philosophical**

--

- Natural processes appear "random". Simulation helps us see how this variation plays out

--

- Gain insight into sampling distributions which underlie Frequentist inference

--

- Statistical models, like regression, are probabilistic. Simulations help us understand their predictions

---

#Simulation and Fake Data

**Practical**

--

- You will use simulations all the time in MLE, Causal Inf, Experiments

--

- It sometimes helps you avoid the hard math

  - Bootstrapping

--

- Bayesian inference is all sampling and simulation

--

- Fake data is a way of life
