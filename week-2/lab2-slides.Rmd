# About Me


+ 6th year PhD Candidate

--

+ Comparative politics: democratic erosion and subnational government.

--

+ Greek

--

+ Resources on Canvas and https://github.com/tdounias/204b-quantitative-methods-f25

--

  + Thanks to Bert Wilden (UCSD PhD and very tall man)
  
---

#Quantitative Workflow

+ Using your research tools *efficiently*, and in a *principled* manner

--

+ **Efficient Workflow:** Am I getting things done quickly and effectively?

--

  + However...
  + ...good code is finished code.
  + Will not "look pretty" for years.

--

+ **Principled Workflow:** Am I taking the right steps to produce *good* science? 

--

  + Reproducibility
  + Transparency

#R vs Stata

.pull-left[
**R**
+ All-in-one package
+ Other Methods courses inR
+ Desirable skill outside academia
+ Vibrant community
]

--

.pull-right[
**Stata**
+ Easier to learn if starting from zero
+ Collaboration and replication?

#Conditional Probability!

- When problems are hard, just follow the rules

--

- Pr(want to know|already know)

--

- Bayes' Theorem

#Bayes Theorem in Action

.equation[
$\text{Pr}(\text{burnt down} \ | \ \text{burnt up}) = \frac{\text{Pr}(\text{burnt down}, \ \text{burnt up})}{\text{Pr}(\text{burnt up})}$
]

---

#Bayes Theorem in Action

.equation[
$\text{Pr}(\text{burnt down} \ | \ \text{burnt up}) = \frac{\color{red}{\text{Pr}(\text{burnt down}, \ \text{burnt up})}}{\text{Pr}(\text{burnt up})}$

.equation[
$\color{red}{\text{Pr}(\text{burnt down}, \ \text{burnt up})} = \ ???$

.equation[
$\color{red}{\text{Pr}(\text{burnt down}, \ \text{burnt up})} = \frac{1}{3}$

#Simulation and Fake Data

Why is this important to know how to do?

--

**Philosophical**

--

- Natural processes appear "random". Simulation helps us see how this variation plays out.

--

- Gain insight into sampling distributions which underlie Frequentist inference.

--

- Statistical models, like regression, are probabilistic. Simulations help us understand their predictions.

---

#Simulation and Fake Data

**Practical**

--

- You will use simulations all the time in MLE, Causal Inf, Experiments.

--

- It sometimes helps you avoid the hard math

  - Bootstrapping

--

- Bayesian inference is all sampling and simulation

---
