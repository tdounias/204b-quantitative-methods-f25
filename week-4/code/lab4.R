## Research Question: 
# What is the relationship between Freedom House scores
# and economic growth among countries?



## Linear regression (OLS) with the lm() function

# lm() means "linear model"
# lm(y ~ x, data = data_name)
mod <- lm(growth ~ fhrev, data = FishData)
# growth = a + b * fhrev + e




## Inspecting the results

# Old fashioned way using summary()
summary(mod)

# The {broom} way returns data frame objects. Very useful!

# broom::tidy() gives variable-level statistics
# (coefs, std.errors, test stats, p.values, interval bounds)
tidy(mod)   
tidy(mod, conf.int = TRUE)

# broom::glance() gives model-level statistics
glance(mod) 

# broom::augment() gives data-level statistics
augment(mod)


# Plot the results!

# Scatter plot of our two variables
plot(FishData$growth ~ FishData$fhrev, 
     xlab = "Freedom House Score", 
     ylab = "GDP Growth", 
     pch = 16,
     col = "steelblue")
# Plotting a fitted line
abline(tidy(mod)$estimate, lwd = 3, col = "black")

# Or in ggplot

  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black", se = F) +
  labs(x = "Freedom House Score", y = "GDP Growth") +
  theme_minimal()


## Let's go deeper into the results of our model

# Create a new data frame object with the data-level statistics
# from our linear regression model
aug_fish <- augment(mod)
head(aug_fish)

# Plotting the fitted values
# What are these things?
plot(x = aug_fish$fhrev,

     xlab = "Freedom House Score",
     ylab = "Predicted GDP Growth",

# More useful: plotting residuals

         x1 = aug_fish$fhrev, y1 = aug_fish$.fitted,
         col = "violet")

# In terms from the lecture
Y <- aug_fish$growth           # Our dependent variable in the regression
X <- aug_fish$fhrev            # Our independent variable in the regression
Y_hat <- aug_fish$.fitted      # The "fitted" or predicted values of Y for each X observation

# RegSS: The variation in Y that our model *does* explain
# Sometimes this is called ESS or "explained sum of squares"
# How much better is our model compared to one that predicted the mean value of Y for every X?

## Some other ways to calculate regression lines ##

# Using the formulas that we saw in lecture:
Y <- FishData$growth
X <- FishData$fhrev

beta <- cor(X, Y) * sd(Y) / sd(X)
alpha <- mean(Y) - beta * mean(X)

# Note that these are the same numbers that we get if we use the lm() function
alpha 
beta
tidy(mod)


# Using Matrix Algebra:

# First a refresher on linear algebra and working with matrices
mat_a <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
mat_b <- matrix(data = c(5, 6, 7, 8),
                nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
mat_a
mat_b

# We can add and subtract matrices that are the same dimensions
mat_a + mat_b
mat_a - mat_b

# Multiply a matrix by a scalar
mat_a * 3

# Multiply two matrices together using %*%
mat_a %*% mat_b

# Transpose a matrix with t()
mat_a
t(mat_a)

# Invert a matrix with solve()
mat_a
solve(mat_a)

# A matrix multiplied by its inverse gives us the identity matrix
mat_a %*% solve(mat_a)


# Putting it all together to solve the OLS equation

Y <- FishData$growth
X <- cbind(1, FishData$fhrev)

# beta = (X'X)^{-1}X'Y
beta <- solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% Y
beta
tidy(mod)$estimate

# This is essentially what R is doing when you call the lm() function.

# The advantage of doing it this way is that it is easier to extend it to the multivariate case:
X <- as.matrix(cbind(1, FishData[, c("fhrev", "elf", "income", "britcol", "postcom", "opec", "muslim")]))

betas <- solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% Y
betas
